Religious names
===============

Religious names can be created on entry to a monastery or other religious order.
For example, `Sister Charlotte`, `Brother Stephen`, or `Pope Gregory`.

Baptismal names may be a replacement for, or an addition to, any traditional names.

The name of a saint can be conferred during a confirmation ceremony.
