Diminutives
===========

Many individuals are known by a diminutive of their given name or [call name](call-name.md).

For example, `Richard` might be known as `Dick`.  Either name may be used, depending on the context.

More complex examples might combine multiple diminutives.  For example, `Margaret Susan` => `Peggy-Sue`.
