Call names
==========

An individual can be known by a given name that is not their first given name, or not any of their given names.

In Germany, the call name (`Rufname`) is one of the official given names.
It is generally underlined when the name is written in full.

In the Netherlands, the call name (`Roepnaam`) may be one of the official given names, a
diminutive of one of the official given names, or some other name.
For example, the full name of the footballer `Johan Cruyff` is `Hendrik Johannes Cruijff`.
The roepnaam is often written in quotation marks, after the given names.  For example `Hendrik Johannes "Johan" Cruijff`.

In the UK (and elsewhere), individuals can be known by a middle name.
For example, the full name of the former UK Prime Minister `Boris Johnson` is `Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson`.
In many cases, the use of a middle name can be a family tradition.
